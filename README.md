It's the question 20 from machine learning course https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/course/ml15fall/hw1/hw1.pdf

Modify your algorithm in Problem 18 to run for 100 updates instead of 50, and verify the
performance of wpocket using the test set. Please repeat your experiment for 2000 times, each with
a different random seed. What is the average error rate on the test set? Plot a histogram to show
error rate versus frequency. Compare your result to Problem 18 and briefly discuss your findings.
